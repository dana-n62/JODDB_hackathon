42Amman JODDB hackathon final project
# 🧩 Technician Task Management & Job Order Tracking System

A digital solution designed to streamline technician workflows, automate performance tracking, and enhance visibility into production progress.  
Developed by **Team 42Amman** — *Esra’a, Amal, Fatima, and Dana* — as part of a case study project to modernize production line management and eliminate manual data bottlenecks.

## 📘 Overview

Our production environment relies on 14 technicians working on hand assembly lines, each assigned to specific stations.  
This project introduces a centralized **web-based management system** that replaces manual reporting with automated data tracking, enabling faster and more accurate insights into:

- Technician productivity and efficiency  
- Job order progress and completion rates  
- Real-time device tracking via serial numbers  
- Delay and issue reporting with automated alerts  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The system aims to:

- Reduce manual data entry and paper-based reporting  
- Improve accuracy and timeliness of technician performance data  
- Provide real-time visibility into production progress  
- Enable proactive management of delays and bottlenecks  
- Support better planning and resource allocation

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 👷 Technician Task & Output Logging
Technicians record completed tasks, quantities, and serial numbers through an intuitive interface.

### 📝 Delay & Notes Reporting
Technicians can add notes to explain issues or delays directly within the system.

### 📊 Automated Performance Metrics
Automatic calculation of:
- **Productivity** (output per time worked)
- **Efficiency** (actual vs. standard task time)
- **Utilization** (active work time vs. available time)

### 🔍 Device & Job Order Tracking
Each device’s serial number is linked to its job order, allowing instant search and progress tracking.

### ⏱️ Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts
Management receives live updates on technician performance, task completion, and upcoming due dates.
